# Deep Learning Final Presentation: Detecting Mask Usage with YOLO-v3-tiny and YOLO-v4 tiny models

## About

### Short Description

In this project, we test the accuracy of the face mask detection using the YOLO v3 and YOLO v4 tiny models. Here, we train and test the models under different conditions. 
To train and test the models, we use [Alexey's Darknet Framework](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet).
